This is a large topic on which much has been written. There are many many more papers we should add here, please feel free to write in with suggestions. Or even better, join the project and start adding them yourself.

### Papers that use the SemanticVectors Package to generate results ###

_Please let us know if you have any articles to add to this list, it is really good for the project to know what results people have obtained using the software._
