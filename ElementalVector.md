An _elemental vector_ is an automatically generated vector generated in a semantic vector space. Elemental vectors can be generated for terms, documents, predicate or relation types, and more or less anything else. The important point is that elemental vectors are generated without reference to the surrounding context --- they are not the result of training.

See [ElementalGenerationMethod](https://semanticvectors.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/latest-stable/pitt/search/semanticvectors/ElementalVectorStore.ElementalGenerationMethod.html) and the [-elementalmethod](https://semanticvectors.googlecode.com/svn/javadoc/latest-stable/pitt/search/semanticvectors/FlagConfig.html#elementalmethod()) flag.

The ways of generating elemental vectors include:

  * Random generation. Random vectors are generated by picking a random number for each coordinate, or by randomly selecting a few coordinates to be non-zero.
  * Hashing generation. The elemental vector is generated by using a hash function on the contents of the item being represented, e.g., the bytes in a string for a term.
    * See [Deterministic Binary Vectors for Efficient Automated Indexing of MEDLINE/PubMed Abstracts](http://proceedings.amia.org/2p8tin/2p8tin/1), Manuel Wahle et al, for early results of this method.
  * [Orthographic generation](OrthographicVectors.md). For string vectors composed of alphabetic characters, elemental vectors can be generated using the orthography of the word.
